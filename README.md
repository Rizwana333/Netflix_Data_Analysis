##### 📊 **Netflix Data Analysis Using Python**

###### 📌 **Overview**

This project analyzes a Netflix dataset to uncover insights about content trends, genres, ratings, and release patterns.

Using Python and data analysis libraries, the project aims to answer questions such as:

* What type of content dominates Netflix (Movies vs TV Shows)?
* Which countries produce the most Netflix content?
* How have release trends changed over time?
