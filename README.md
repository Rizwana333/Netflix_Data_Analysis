# Netflix_Data_Analysis
📊 Netflix Data Analysis Using Python
📌 Overview
This project analyzes a Netflix dataset to uncover insights about content trends, genres, ratings, and release patterns.
Using Python and data analysis libraries, the project aims to answer questions such as:

What type of content dominates Netflix (Movies vs TV Shows)?

Which countries produce the most Netflix content?

How have release trends changed over time?

What are the most popular genres?

The analysis can help understand content patterns, viewer preferences, and production trends on the platform.
